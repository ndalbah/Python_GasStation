# Python - Gas Station Project
A gas station is selling fuel with the following discount table: 
- Diesel: 
  - Up to 20 liters.
  - 3% discount per liter over 20 liters.
  - 5% discount per liter.
- Gasoline: 
  - Up to 20 liters.
  - 4% discount per liter over 20 liters.
  - 6% discount per liter.

Write an algorithm that reads the number of liters sold, the type of fuel (coded as follows: D-diesel, G-gasoline),
calculates and prints the amount to be paid by the customer knowing that the price of a
liter of Gasoline is CAD$ 2.50 the price of a liter of Diesel is CAD$ 1.90.
